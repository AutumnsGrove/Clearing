# Clearing — ARCHIVED

> ⚠️ **This repository has been archived.**

The Clearing status page implementation lives in the main GroveEngine monorepo:

**Active location:** [AutumnsGrove/GroveEngine](https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/GroveEngine) → `clearing/` directory

## Why?

Clearing shares the D1 database with the main Grove engine, so keeping them in the same repo simplifies deployment and maintenance. This repo was created from a template but never developed — all the real work happened in GroveEngine.

## What is Clearing?

Clearing is Grove's public status page at `status.grove.place`. It shows platform health, incident history, and scheduled maintenance. Named after a clearing in a forest — an open space where you can see what's happening.
